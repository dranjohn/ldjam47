Nirvana - a JavaScript game for Ludum Dare 47
=============================================

This is the game "Nirvana".
It was our submission to the Jam category of [Ludum Dare 47][1] in 2020-10.
It was the first time for both of us to participate in a game jam.

How to play the game
--------------------

You can run the game in two ways:
you can play it online on [itch.io][2], or you can play it locally.
To play the game locally, first download all files and directories.
Then open the "index.html" file in your browser.

Use the arrow keys to walk around and to select a dialog option.
Use the X key to talk to an NPC and to confirm a dialog option.

There are five different endings.
You have reached an ending when you can no longer talk to any NPC.
You can then reload the page and play again.
If you feel stuck, try only walking to the right.

Licenses
--------

The game had initially been licensed under the MIT License.
This is no longer the case:
we have decided to relicense it under [GPL-3.0-or-later][3].
Supporting files are licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0][4].

The game complies with the [REUSE][5] specification:
you can find all used licenses in the "LICENSES" directory.

You can browse the source code on [GitHub][6].

The authors
-----------

The game was written by dranjohn and [Daniel Kalak][7].
Daniel Kalak went by the pseudonym "nidrig" during the initial release.
