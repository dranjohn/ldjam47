Nirvana
=======

This is our game for the [Ludum Dare 47][1] Jam in October 2020.
It is the first time we participate.

You can play the game on [itch.io][2].
Use the arrow keys to navigate and the X key to perform an action.

There are five different endings.
You have reached an ending when you cannot do anything any more.
You can then reload the page and play again.

The game is licensed under the MIT (Expat) License.
You can view the [source code here][3].
